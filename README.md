# Sentiment analysis 

Course project for the Deep Learning Course 2022 at HSE & ITMO. For full pipeline check [GitHub project](https://github.com/VadimShabashov/transformers-for-text-analysis).

Open huggingface ðŸ¤— [emotions dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion) was used.

Check kaggle notebooks, since there are some troubles with rendering plots on GitHub: [tf-idf](https://www.kaggle.com/code/xyinspired/baseline-tf-idf-sentiment-analysis/notebook) and [BERT](https://www.kaggle.com/code/xyinspired/bert-sentiment-emotions-analysis).

In this work two approaches are compared:

* Baseline solution - using TF-IDF vectorization

* Transfromers solution - BERT model
